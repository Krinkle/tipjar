# Tipjar

Tipjar is a browser extension that makes it easy to give money directly to your favorite sites and creators. When the site you have open accepts direct contributions, you'll see a green money icon in your browser's toolbar. All you have to do is click it, and you'll be sent to the appropriate page. Tipjar isn't a payment processor, only a referral/discovery tool, so it doesn't take a cut of payments or require that sites set up complicated accounts to receive money.

Tipjar looks for [code in the page's header](https://github.com/corbindavenport/tipjar/wiki/Tipjar-Meta-Tag) that links to a donation/support page. If one isn't found, the extension will check its [internal list of sites](https://github.com/corbindavenport/tipjar/blob/master/js/sites.js) for an available option. Tipjar can also detect a variety of other payment options (cryptocurrency, [Scroll](https://scroll.com/), etc.), and will display buttons for them if available.
